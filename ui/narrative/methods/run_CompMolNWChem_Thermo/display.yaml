    Input_File :
        ui-name : |
            Reaction ID (EC or ModelSEED)
        short-hint : |
            The desired single reaction with EC or ModelSEED IDs
        long-hint  : |
            The desired single reaction with EC (E.C.:3.2.1.52) reaction ID or ModelSEED (rxn38348) reaction ID
    Input_Method :
        ui-name : |
            Single Reaction or List?
        short-hint : |
            Are you inputting a single reaction or inputting a csv?
        long-hint  : |
            If you want a single reaction, type it above and select Reaction ID. If  you want a list, put them into a csv and select Reaction list and continue to next step.
    Input_List :
        ui-name : |
            (Optional) List of Reactions
        short-hint : |
            A csv of reactions
        long-hint  : |
           If you have a list of reactions in a csv file, you can upload them here to calculate all of them.
